1) I scraped the data using the github api by creating a personal access token. The python script is available in script.py file. I have deleted my access token so the script won't run as is. You can create your own access token to run the script yourself.
2) An interesting obsercation is that the language with most repos is Javascript with Python in a close second.
3) An actionable recommendation I would give to developers is to shift more towards in demand languages like python, javascript, etc.
